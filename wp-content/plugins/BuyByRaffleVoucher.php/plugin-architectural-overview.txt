General Overview

The "BuyByRaffle Vouchers" plugin is structured into several key directories and files, each serving specific purposes:

    apis/: Contains PHP files that define REST API endpoints for voucher-related operations.
    libraries/: Includes PHP scripts for various functionalities like publishing and consuming messages from Google Cloud Pub/Sub and voucher generation.
    payment/: Holds the WooCommerce payment gateway integration file.
    Root Directory: Contains the main plugin file (voucher.php), batch table creation script (batches-table.php), and Composer's configuration files (composer.json, composer.lock).

Key Functionalities
Voucher Management

    Voucher Generation: Vouchers are generated and managed through a combination of REST API endpoints and background processes.
    Database Interaction: Uses global $wpdb for direct interaction with the WordPress database, maintaining tables for batches and individual vouchers.
    Voucher Redemption: Offers an endpoint for redeeming vouchers, changing their status from 'active' to 'used'.

Google Cloud Pub/Sub Integration

    Publishing Messages: Scripts in the libraries/ directory are responsible for publishing messages to specific topics in Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
    Consuming Messages: The plugin consumes messages from Pub/Sub for asynchronous processing, such as generating voucher pins or sending voucher details via email.

WooCommerce Integration

    Provides a custom WooCommerce payment gateway (WC_Gateway_PGS_Voucher) that allows customers to pay using vouchers.

REST API Endpoints

    Endpoint Registration: Utilizes WordPress's REST API framework to register custom endpoints for various voucher operations like redeeming, fetching details, and sending vouchers by email.
    JWT Authentication: Employs JWT for securing specific endpoints, ensuring that requests are authenticated and authorized.

Security and Best Practices

    Sanitization and Validation: Input data is sanitized and validated, particularly in REST API endpoints, to prevent security vulnerabilities.
    Error Handling and Logging: Implements comprehensive error handling and logging mechanisms for easier debugging and monitoring.
    Database Transactions: Uses transactions for critical operations to ensure data integrity.

Plugin Activation and Usage

    Upon activation, the plugin creates necessary database tables.
    Admin users can manage vouchers through the WordPress admin panel and WooCommerce integration.
    The plugin offers a seamless experience for end-users, allowing voucher redemption and management through REST API endpoints.

Development and Deployment

    Environment-Specific Configuration: The plugin uses different configurations for local, development, staging, and production environments, especially for Pub/Sub interactions.
